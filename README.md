📔 World 8 - The Story:

"Your family has for generations pressed "The Button" to keep the sun shining, which only needs to be done every hundred year. You lost interest in it when you hit your teens and after all the partying and traveling you had completely forgot about your responsibility and the process how to press this well hidden (from the world) button. You realize that it's already the year 3000 and it's YOUR duty to save the world! You need to find all the heirloom from your family to remember how to get to the button and find keys desiphering the cryptig riddles left behind by your ancestors."
